# SWD-Exercise
Instructions
Imagine you are responsible for conducting a brief staff survey. The findings will be shared with senior leadership, who will address any issues found. A colleague has visualised the survey results, and asks you for feedback.
Study this visual; then, complete the following steps, making assumptions as needed in the spirit of the exercise. 
STEP 1: What do you appreciate about the design of this graph? What input might you offer to improve it? There is an art to giving thoughtful feedback. Frame your suggestions in a positive and constructive way. Consider how you would like to receive feedback on your own work, and use that as your guide.
STEP 2: Identify an action for your audience. We should always strive to motivate our primary audience to do something after we deliver our communication—even if it’s as simple as “understand the data and consider next steps.” Is there a particular survey item that needs addressing immediately? Should items that are more polarised be the point of focus? Choose and write down one specific action that you want your primary audience to take. 
STEP 3: Remake the graph, incorporating your suggested feedback and call to action. You can download the data and use your preferred tool of choice to create your makeover. Upload an image as your solution and share your feedback from STEP 1 in your commentary.
